\# DiaCare AI — Smart Diabetes \& Foot Ulcer Analyzer



A comprehensive healthcare application developed as part of a Bachelor's degree project that combines machine learning for diabetes risk prediction and deep learning for foot ulcer detection.



\## 🌟 Features



\- \*\*Diabetes Risk Prediction\*\*: Uses machine learning to predict diabetes risk based on clinical parameters

\- \*\*Foot Ulcer Detection\*\*: Implements deep learning for early detection of diabetic foot ulcers

\- \*\*Patient Records Management\*\*: SQLite database for storing and managing patient records

\- \*\*Automated Report Generation\*\*: Creates detailed PDF reports of diagnoses

\- \*\*User-Friendly Interface\*\*: Built with Streamlit for easy navigation and use
